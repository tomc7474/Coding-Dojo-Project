My project would be an online space to share
recipes with other users. The user would be brought
to the login/registration page to either create a
new account along with a password, or be able to
enter using their email and password if they already
have an account. The user would then be brought to
the dashboard where they would be able to see all the
recipes they have created along with the recipes
other users have created. When the user clicks on the
recipe, they will be able to see information such as
prep time, cook, time, ingredients, and instructions.
The user will also be able to like or dislike the
recipe. If the user has created the recipe, they
will be able to edit it. When creating or editing a
recipe you must input the name and all information 
specified above.
